This is an image sharing site that I have made. We have HTML and CSS for the site itself.
The more interesting part is what I've done with JavaScript, initially I had created functions to handle liking image status, adding an image to the DOM, editing profile information, and opening and closing modals. I have sense updated this to use REST API's to run functions and send information to a server using Webpack and NPM to manage the server and fetch requests.
